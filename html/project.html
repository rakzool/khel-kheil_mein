        <hr size=green>
    </CENTER>

    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a
    20-metre (22-yard) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting
    side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the bowling and fielding side tries
    to prevent this and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball
    hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but
    before it hits the ground. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game
    is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate
    with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

    There are quite a few formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single
    innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for two
    innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear
    club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by
    the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a
    cork core layered with tightly wound string.

    Historically, cricket's origins are uncertain and the earliest definite reference is in south-east England in the
    middle of the 16th century. It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, leading to the first
    international matches in the second half of the 19th century. The game's governing body is the International Cricket
    Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches. The game's rules
    are held in a code called the Laws of Cricket which is owned and maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in
    London. The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa
    and the West Indies, its globalisation occurring during the expansion of the British Empire and remaining popular
    into the 21st century.[1] Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international
    standard. The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day
    International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side
    more than any other country.<br>

    Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from
    the modern game in certain key technical aspects. The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground
    towards a batsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low, two-stump
    wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.[13][14][15]

    In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state
    that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they
    were playing cricket. They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.[16] This is the earliest mention of adult
    participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village
    match was played – at Chevening, Kent.[5][17] In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally
    struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.[18]

    Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.[9] It is known, through numerous references
    found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and
    during the Commonwealth.[19][20] The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered
    cricket to be "profane" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.[21][22]

    According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a "great upsurge of sport after the Restoration" in 1660.
    Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes
    to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population. Along with
    prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport. Rich patrons made
    matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players. By the end of the
    century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken
    abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated A 1697 newspaper
    report survives of "a great cricket match" played in Sussex "for fifty guineas apiece" – this is the earliest known
    contest that is generally considered a First Class match.

        <h1> <b><u>RULES</b></u>
            <hr size=green>
        </h1>
    </CENTER>
    1. Two teams, 22 players: Purdue University explains that a cricket match is little more than two teams facing off
    against each other. Each team has 11 players on the field. One of a team's 11 players is the team captain. This
    player is primarily responsible for ensuring that a team has no more than 11 players on the field at any given
    time.<br>

    2. Umpires' rulings are final: Lord's notes that the umpire is the final authority in play decisions. Players who
    fail to follow directions or who balk at an umpire's decision will be turned over to the team captain for dismissal
    or other discipline measures.<br>

    3. Six balls equal one over: The bowler bowls the cricket ball to the striker. If the latter hits it and misses, the
    ball is considered completed. After the bowler delivers six balls, he has completed an "over." Another team member
    now takes a turn to bowl the next over.<br>

    4. Game duration is negotiated: Teams may agree to play two innings and limit the number of hours they will be on
    the field. In the alternative, the teams may opt to only play one innings but do so by agreeing on the number of
    overs ahead of time.<br>

    5. Professional-level cricket matches are limited duration games: Even so, these games -- usually referred to as
    test matches -- last six hours per day and continue for five days. Since test matches must use natural light only,
    playtime is set between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.<br>

    6. Batsmen do not have to run: American audiences are familiar with baseball players tossing aside their bats and
    running from base to base. In cricket, the batsmen carry their bats with them as they run and use them to touch the
    ground marking their progress. It is noteworthy that they do not have to run.<br>

    7. Boundary fence hit equals four runs: Cricket recognizes that a batsman's ability to hit the fence with a bowled
    ball should equal four runs. If the ball goes beyond the boundary fence, the batsman scores six runs.<br>

    8. Overthrows allow for additional runs: Should fielders neglect to throw the ball back, the batsmen will continue
    taking runs. If the ball rolls to the boundary of the field, the runs already completed are added to the automatic
    four-run score a boundary hit earns.<br>

    9. Time wasting is penalized: It is well known that cricket games can go on for days. In order to curtail time
    wasting, a new batsman is out of the game if it takes him longer than two minutes to take the field after a wicket
    fall.<br>

    10. Field placement is optional: The team captain may choose to place team members in a number of field positions.
    Each captain uses this strategy to the advantage of the team and to throw off the strategy of the opposing team.

        <hr size=green>
    </CENTER>
    Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players
    each.[58] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary,
    which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if
    possible be marked along its entire length.[59]

    In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a
    wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[60] The pitch is a flat surface 3 metres
    (9.8 ft) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played
    on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.[61]

                <h1>BAT AND BALL</h1></b></u>
        <hr size=green>
    </CENTER>
    The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards
    the batsman who, armed with a bat, is "on strike" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay).

    The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical
    handle. The blade must not be more than four and one quarter inches (108 mm) wide and the total length of the bat
    not more than 38 inches (965 mm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb
    (1.1 and 1.4 kg).[71][72]

    The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 22.9 centimetres (9.0 in). The ball has a
    "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior. The seam on a
    new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of
    the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its
    behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to
    modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or
    saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through
    the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are
    illegal ball tampering.

    Women's cricket was first recorded in Surrey in 1745.[112] International development began at the start of the 20th
    century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.[113] The following year,
    New Zealand women joined them, and in 2007 Netherlands women became the tenth women's Test nation when they made
    their debut against South Africa women. In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged
    with the ICC in 2005).[113] In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was
    held in England.[113] In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket
    Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket. The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on
    1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket. In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award
    T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and

        <hr size=green>
    </CENTER>
    The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of
    cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and
    South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989.[113] The
    ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket.[115] The ICC is
    responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and
    women's versions of the Cricket World Cup. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all
    sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.

    Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the
    national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.[116] In the West Indies, which for cricket
    purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indie.

                <h1>TYPES OF MATCHES</h1></b></u>
        <hr size=green>
    </CENTER>
    Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket,
    limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket. The highest standard is Test cricket (always written
    with a capital "T") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams
    representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above). Although the term "Test match" was
    not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in
    the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a
    trophy known as The Ashes. The term "first-class", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket. Test
    matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are
    allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.[120]

    Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings
    each. There are two types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have
    twenty overs each. Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI)
    and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested
    by the first-class county clubs. In 1969, a national league competition was established. The concept was gradually
    introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971. In
    1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England. Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the
    purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session. The first Twenty20
    World Championship was held in 2007. Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an
    unfinished match is a "no result".[121][122]

    Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class. In
    this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must
    face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket
    began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.
