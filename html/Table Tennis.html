        <h2> Introduction</h2>
        <hr />
        <p style="font-size:large">
            As we all know, how important it is to associate one with some sporting activity to lead a healthy lifestyle and maintain a healthy physically active body. Table Tennis is one such activity which gives us an opportunity to lead just the life we all want to lead, a healthy and physically active one. It is played with wooden bats with rubber on their either sides usually of red and balck color distinctively which they use to hit a plastic ball which serves as the match decider.<br />
            As the name itself suggests, the game is played on the table and is a small, faster and more agility requiring form of tennis. While tennis is about lengthy pick-ups and long runs, table tenis is about instinctiveness and short puts. The game is more faster, quicker and harder than tennis. A game for 2 or 4 players where 2 players play against each other and 4 players play as teams against the other. The rules are very clear and hold some resemblance to tennis, i.e. - <br />
            - <em>Keep the ball on the table or else the other guy gets the point.</em><br />
            - <em>Two bounces on your side of the table and you lose a point to the other guy.</em><br />
            - <em>Ball touches the net while serving results in re-serve.</em><br /> <br />
            These were some of the basic rules of table tennis. Now, we shall know more about the game.
