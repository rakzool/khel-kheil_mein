            <h2><b>Athletics in India</b></h2>
            <img src="../assets/Hima_1.jpeg" alt="Tracks" class="hima">


            <p>
                In India, the sport of athletics was introduced during the period of the British Raj.
                sport is governed at national level by the Athletics Federation of India, which was formed in 1946.
                Despite its large population, at the top level of the sport few Indian athletes have won a medal in
                a global or major championship.
                This began to change in the 21st century, when Indians started taking greater interest in athletics
                more generally and improved facilities for the sport began to be built at a local level.
                At a continental level, it has been among the more successful Asian nations, though some distance
                behind China and Japan.
                No Indian athlete has won an Olympic medal in athletics, aside from Norman Pritchard who competed in the
                non-national era. Women's long jumper Anju Bobby George is the only Indian to have won a medal at the
                IAAF World Championships in Athletics, doing so in 2003.

                At national level, there are three major athletics competitions: the annual Indian National Open
                Athletics Championships and Indian Inter State Senior Athletics Championships (both first held in 1961),
                and the quadrennial National Games of India (first held in 1924). An Indian National Championships
                event predated the Open and Inter State ones, being held from 1924 until 1961. An Indian Marathon
                Championships was first contested in 1938, while the Indian Cross Country Championships celebrated
                its 50th edition in 2015. An Indian Racewalking Championships was established in 2014. In addition
                to the main senior championships there are championships for under-20 and under-18 athletes at national
                and sub-national levels, as well as senior, non-championship competitions in the form of the Athletics
                Federation Cup and Indian Athletics Grand Prix tour.
            </p>

            <h2><b>History</b></h2>
            <img src="../assets/history.jpg" alt="HISTORY" class="hima">
            <p>
            <h4><b>20th century</b></h4>
            <p>
                At the Olympic Games, the first Indian competitor was Norman Pritchard, an Anglo-Indian, who won
                silver medals in the 200 metres and 200 metres hurdles at the 1900 Summer Olympics.These remain
                the only athletics medals for India at the Olympics. The first indigenous Indians to compete at
                the games were sprinter Purma Bannerjee, and distance runners Phadeppa Chaugule and Sadashir Datar
                at the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. The nation continued to send athletes to the Olympic athletics
                competition every four years, with Nilima Ghose and Mary D'Souza Sequeira becoming India's first
                female Olympians at the 1952 Helsinki Games.
            </p>
            <p>

                At a regional level, India took part in the 1930 Far Eastern Championship Games, but failed to win
                any medals. The nation hosted the Western Asiatic Games and won all but three of the athletics
                events. India was the host of the debut Asian Games in 1951 and finished second to Japan in the
                athletics medal table, which included a men's sprint double by Lavy Pinto and two silvers in women's
                sprints by Roshan Mistry. The country was less successful at the 1954 Asian Games, though
                Parduman Singh Brar managed a shot put/javelin double and Christine Brown, Stephie D'Souza, Violet
                Peters, Mary D'Souza Sequeira gave India its first women athletics gold medal, taking the 4 × 100
                metres relay title.
            </p>
            <p>

                Milkha Singh was India's first athlete to gain success at a global level, earning the nickname "The
                Flying Sikh". He won a 200 metres/400 metres double at the 1958 Asian Games before going on to
                take the 440 yards title at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games – India's first winner at that
                competition. He finished fourth in the 400 m at the 1960 Summer Olympics. Decathlete
                Gurbachan Singh Randhawa won gold at the 1962 Asian Games and placed fifth in the 110 metres hurdles
                final at the 1964 Olympic Games. Throws athlete Praveen Kumar was the sole Indian athletics
                medallist at the 1966 British Empire and Commonwealth Games and won back-to-back Asian Games discus
                titles from 1966 to 1970 (achievements that he converted into a film career).
            </p>
            <p>

                In the 1970s, Indian athletes had increased regional success. Kamaljeet Sandhu became the first
                Indian female athlete to win an individual Asian Games gold medal, taking the 1970 title in the 400
                metres. Decathlete Vijay Singh Chauhan winning the Asian Athletics Championships and Asian Games
                titles in 1973 and 1974. Men's triple jumper Mohinder Singh Gill won at the 1970 Asian Games, took
                the first two decathlon titles of the Asian Athletics Championships (1973 and 1975), as well as
                taking two minor medals at the Commonwealth Games. Sriram Singh established India in
                middle-distance running, winning two Asian Games golds and a silver that decade, three gold medals
                at the 1975 Asian Athletics Championships, and a seventh place finish 1976 Olympic 800 m
                final. Shivnath Singh won four distance medals at the Asian Championships, placed 11th at
                the 1976 Olympic Marathon and set a long-standing national marathon record in 1978. In the
                second half of the decade, Hari Chand (long-distance), Bahadur Singh Chouhan (shot put), Hakam Singh
                (racewalking) and Suresh Babu (multi-events) each won multiple Asian medals and titles.
            </p>

                The Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed as the national stadium in preparation for hosting the
                1982 Asian Games, representing an improvement in India's elite level sports infrastructure. India
                was third in the athletics rankings at the competition, behind the regional leaders China and Japan.
                Charles Borromeo (long jump), Chand Ram (racewalking), Bahadur Singh Chouhan, and M. D. Valsamma
                (hurdles) all won gold with games record performances. The competition marked an era of increased
                success for India's women athletes: Geeta Zutshi took two silver medals in middle-distance running
                and 18-year-old P. T. Usha won her first major medals with two silvers in the sprints. Usha
                reached the final of Women's 400 metres hurdles at 1984 Summer Olympics, setting an Asian record
                time in fourth place, and also helped the Indian women's 4 × 400 metres relay to the final. Usha
                went on to win four gold medals at the 1986 Asian Games and an unprecedented four individual titles
                at the 1985 Asian Athletics Championships. She was the nation's leading athlete at the 1989 Asian
                Athletics Championships, held in New Delhi, winning four gold meadls and one silver. Usha
                continued to win medals at continental level into the late 1990s.
            </p>
            <p>

                Usha won three of India's six athletics medals at the 1990 Asian Games, but the emergence of Qatar
                and South Korea saw India fall down the country rankings. Women's runner Shiny Wilson led the nation
                with two golds and a silver at the 1991 Asian Athletics Championships. Men's distance runner Bahadur
                Prasad set national records and took a gold and a silver medal at the 1993 Asian Athletics
                Championships. The 1994 Asian Games highlighted India's fall at regional level again: with zero
                golds, women's runners Usha, Wilson and Kutty Saramma were involved in the nation's minor medals.
                Jyotirmoyee Sikdar marked her breakthrough in middle-distance with India's sole gold medals at the
                1995 Asian Athletics Championships and the 1998 Asian Games. Usha won the final gold medal of her
                career with the women's 4 × 100 metres relay team at the 1998 Asian Athletics Championships, which
                was India's only gold that year.
            </p>

            <h4><b>21th century</b></h4>
            <p>

            <p>
                The start of the 21st century coincided with an improvement in the standard of performances in the sport
                in India. The country placed second at the 2000 Asian Athletics Championships, taking 21 of the medals
                available. It fell down the rankings at the 2002 edition, but still won ten medals and retained the
                women's 4 × 400 m relay title. After a long medal drought at the competition, discus thrower Neelam
                Jaswant Singh and long jumper Anju Bobby George reached the podium at the 2002 Commonwealth Games,
                becoming the first Indian women to do so. The 2002 Asian Games saw India return as a force at
                regional level, winning seven gold and 17 medals overall in athletics. On the women's side, Singh and
                George both won gold, K. M. Beenamol won 800 m and 4 × 400 m relay gold, Saraswati Saha won the 200 m,
                and Sunita Rani set the current Asian Games record in the 1500 metres. Bahadur Singh Sagoo was the sole
                men's gold medallist in the shot put.

            </p>
            <p>
                Anju Bobby George made history when she won the bronze medal in Women's long jump at the 2003 World
                Championships in Athletics in Paris. With this achievement, she became the first Indian athlete ever to
                win a global athletics medal. Over the rest of the decade, she took fifth at the 2004 Summer Olympics,
                made two more finals at the World Championships in Athletics, won an Asian Championships title, and four
                more silver medals at Asian level. The Indian women's 4 × 400 metres relay team established itself
                as one of the best in the region in this decade, taking silver at the 2006 Commonwealth Games, gold at
                the 2006 Asian Games, seventh at the 2004 Olympics, and two Asian Championships titles in 2005 and
                2007. Among the Indian relay runners were several athletes with individual success: Manjeet Kaur
                (2004 Asian Games runner-up), Chitra Soman (2007 Asian Championships winner) and Sathi Geetha (2005
                Asian Championships runner-up). Other athletes who were successful during this period included 2007
                Asian Championships men's triple jump champion Renjith Maheshwary, indoor and outdoor Asian men's shot
                put champion Navpreet Singh, Asian heptathlon medallists J. J. Shobha and Soma Biswas, and multiple
                Asian women's middle-distance runner Sinimole Paulose. Men's shot putter Om Prakash Karhana was India's
                sole winner at the 2009 Asian Athletics Championships, setting a championship record in the process.
