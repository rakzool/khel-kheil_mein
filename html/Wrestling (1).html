                                       Wrestling is a combat sport involving grappling-type techniques such as clinch fighting, throws and takedowns, joint locks, pins and other grappling holds. The sport can either be theatrical for entertainment (see professional wrestling), or genuinely competitive and it is of different types like Folkstyle, Freestyle, Greco-Roman, Judo, Sombo and others. A wrestling bout is a physical competition, between two (occasionally more) competitors or sparring partners, who attempt to gain and maintain a superior position. There are a wide range of styles with varying rules with both traditional historic and modern styles. Wrestling techniques have been incorporated into other martial arts as well as military hand-to-hand combat systems.

                                       The ancient Indian form of wrestling is called malla-yuddha. Practiced at least since the 5th millennium BC, described in the 13th century treatise Malla Purana, it was the precursor of modern kushti.
                                       <br />
                                       In the 16th century, northern India was conquered by the Central Asian Mughals, who were of Turko-Mongol descent. Through the influence of Iranian and Mongolian wrestling, given time, the local malla-yuddha was supplanted by Persian Koshti. Interestingly, the aspects of Malla-yuddha survived in the culture of the Akhad (wrestling academy): Students are expected to be vegetarian, cook, take care of the facility, and be celibate.
                                       <br />
                                       Babur, the first Mughal emperor, was a wrestler himself and could reportedly run very fast for a long distance while holding a man under each arm. Mughal-era wrestlers sometimes even wore bagh naka on one hand, in a variation called naki ka kushti or "claw wrestling".
                                       uring the late 17th century, Ramadasa travelled the country encouraging Hindus to physical activity in homage to the great god Hanuman. Maratha rulers supported kushti by offering large sums of prize money for tournament champions. It was said that every Maratha boy at the time could wrestle and even women took up the sport. During the colonial period, local princes sustained the popularity of kushti by hosting matches and competitions. Wrestling was the favourite spectator sport of the Rajputs, and were said to look forward to tournaments "with great anxiety". Every Rajput prince or chief had a number of wrestling champions to compete for his entertainment. The greatest wrestling centres were said to be Uttar Pradesh and the Panjab.
                                       <br />
                                       In 1909, a Bengali merchant named Adbul Jabbar Saudagar intended to unite the local youth and inspire them in the anti-British struggle against the colonists through a display of strength by holding a wrestling tournament. Known as Jabbar-er Boli Khela, this competition has continued through independence and the subsequent partition. It is still held in Bangladesh every Boishakhi Mela (Bengali new year), accompanied by playing of the traditional sanai (flute) and dabor (drum), and is one of Chittagong's oldest traditions.
                                       <br />
                                       In the more recent past, India had famous wrestlers of the class of the Great Gama (of British India and later Pakistan, after partition) and Gobar Goho. India reached its peak of glory in the IV Asian Games (later on called Jakarta Games) in 1962 when all the seven wrestlers were placed on the medal list and in between them they won 12 medals in freestyle wrestling and Greco-Roman wrestling. A repetition of this performance was witnessed again when all the 8 wrestlers sent to the Commonwealth Games held at Kingston, Jamaica had the distinction of getting medals for the country. During the 60s, India was ranked among the first eight or nine wrestling nations of the world and hosted the world wrestling championships in New Delhi in 1967.

                                       Pehlwans who compete in wrestling nowadays are also known to cross train in the grappling aspects of judo and jujutsu. Legendary wrestlers from the bygone era like Karl Gotch have made tours to India to learn kushti and further hone their skills. Karl Gotch was even gifted a pair of mugdar (heavy wooden clubs used for building the arm and shoulder muscles by South Asian wrestlers). The conditioning exercises of pehlwani have been incorporated into many of the conditioning aspects of both catch wrestling and shoot wrestling, along with their derivative systems.

                                       <h3>The Phogat Sisters</h3>
                                       <img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal%2Fimport%2F2016%2F12%2FPhogat.jpeg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true" width="400" height="250" style="float:right">
                                       The Phogat sisters are six sisters from Haryana, India, all of whom are wrestlers. In order of their dates of birth, they are: Geeta, Babita, Priyanka, Ritu, Vinesh and Sangita. While Geeta, Babita, Ritu and Sangita are daughters of former wrestler and coach Mahavir Singh Phogat, Priyanka and Vinesh were brought up by Mahavir after their father, who is the brother of Mahavir, was killed in a land dispute. Mahavir trained all six of them in wrestling in their home village of Balali in Bhiwani district.
                                       <br />
                                       Three of the Phogat sisters Geeta, Babita and Vinesh are gold medalists in different weight categories at the Commonwealth Games, while Priyanka has won a silver medal at the Asian Championships. Ritu is a National Championships gold medalist and Sangita has won medals at age-level international championships.
                                       <br />
                                       The success of the Phogat sisters has attracted substantial media attention, particularly due to the prevalent social issues in Haryana such as gender inequality, female foeticide and child marriage. The Bollywood film Dangal released in India on 23 December 2016 is based on the lives of Phogat sisters with Mahavir, Geeta and Babita as its main characters. Wrestler Pooja Dhanda was screened and originally selected to play the role of Babita Phogat in Dangal which she could not play due to an injury, and later she went on to defeat senior Phogat sister Geeta in the real life national championship.

                                       Chandgi Ram's daughters, Sonika and Deepika, sowed the seeds of encouraging girls to take up the women's wrestling in the 1990s, his protege Mahavir Phogat's daughters revolutionized wrestling, and then Sakshi Malik won an Olympic medal, which had now led to big change in mentality towards women playing wrestling due to the role of like Master Chandgi Ram and Mahavir Singh Phogat.
