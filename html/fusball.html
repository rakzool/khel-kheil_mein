        <h4><b>The Rise of Football in India</b></h4>

        <p>

          The sports sector in India has witnessed several recent developments,
          which have contributed to its significant growth. Although cricket continues to be the leading sport in the
          country,
          other sports have also gathered sizeable interest over the past few years. Establishment of new leagues in
          football,
          hockey and less established sports such as kabaddiis are changing the face of Indian sports: players are
          getting a global stage to
          showcase their talent and viewers are getting the opportunity to get more involved in their favorite sports.


        </p>
        <p>
          India has evolved from a single sport nation to a multi-sport country. However, to further improve sports
          participation, there is a need to build a
          culture of sports in the country through better infrastructure, increased corporate investments and
          promotion
          by the Government. This will help unlock the untapped
          business potential of sports across the fields of marketing/sponsorship, sports management, sports goods and
          apparel, sports infrastructure and sports tourism.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such league currently making its mark in India at the moment is the Indian Super League (ISL)
          for football. Although the game was always popular across certain
          regions and pockets of society, the league has given it mainstream attention. For instance, the AIFF has
          established a Strategic Plan for the next 3 years

          <h4><b>Rules And Regulations</b></h4>
          <br>

          <center>
            <img src="../assets/refre.jpg" alt="refree" class="cnt2">
          </center>
          <br>

          <p>
          <h5><b>Object of the Game</b></h5>
          The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match
          is
          split up into two halves of
          45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period
          called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee
          (injury time) will be accordingly.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
          <h5><b>Players & Equipment</b></h5>

          Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players.
          The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards
          wide. On each pitch you will have a 6 yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard
          box and a centre circle.
          Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.
          Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football.
          Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips.
          The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the
          ball.
          Each team will have a designated captain.
          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
          <h5><b>Scoring</b></h5>
          To score the ball must go into your opponentâ€™s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a
          legitimate goal.
          A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder.
          The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.

          </p>
          <br>

          <p>
          <h5><b>Winning the Game</b></h5>
          To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents.
          If the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart from in cup games
          where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout to decide the winner.
          Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers
          who
          can use any part of their body within
          the 18 yard box (of which more can be found out in the next section).

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          <h5><b>Rules of Football (Soccer)</b></h5>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.</li>
            <li>
              Each team can have a minimum off 11 players
              (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box)
              and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
            </li>
            <li>
              The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but
              must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide.
              The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds,
              two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of
              both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with
              each team being able to make a maximum
              of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three
              substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play
              without a replacement for that player.
            </li>
            <li>
              Each game must include one referee and two assistant refereeâ€™s (linesmen).
              Itâ€™s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such
              as
              fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties
              and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in
              the match regarding a decision.
              Itâ€™s the assistant refereeâ€™s job to spot offsideâ€™s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team
              and
              also assist the referee in all
              decision making processes where appropriate.

            </li>
            <li>
              If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a
              match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
            </li>
            <li>
              The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
            </li>
            <li>
              For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the
              foul; this comes down to the refereeâ€™s discretion.
              The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player.
              Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in.
              If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off
              a
              defending player it is a corner kick.
            </li>
          </ul>
